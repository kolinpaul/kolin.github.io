My research interests focus on the use of (embedded) heterogeneous [gpu, cpu, FPGA] systems in the design of high performance accelerators for HPC, affordable health care, security of cyberphysical systems and [more recently] quantum computing. I lead the  Systems Activities [Transpiler and Pulse Generation] of the **Quantum Computer Project** at IIT Delhi funded by the **National Quantum Mission**.
I am always in the lookout for folks who are interested in a  doing a PhD.I will only respond to emails  requesting for positions in my group if the email has the word “_hollings_” in the salutation --- the word is an anagram for where I spent the first part of my life and is part of my sweetest memories. I am looking for students who would line to work in the general area of Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems. 

I am specifically looking for PhD and MSR students to work in the area of Quantum Logic Synthesis and Quantum Compilers as we explore the use of Unconventional Computing Paradigms to build/explore low energy efficient solutions. 

On the systems side, we are looking at making systems secure using a combination of new architecture [HSM] primitives and TEE to provide enhanced cyber resilience in different verticals. 

Currently, I have a number [at least 5] of PhD positions open -- some are Institute funded and some are Industry funded. 
In case you have an interest in accelerating applications using a mix of FPGAs and GPUs, please do write to me with  _hollingsAcc_ in the subject line.

If you have interest in developing FPGA based solutions to work in the context of Error Correction and control signal generation for a Quantum processor OR in the general area of Quantum Compilation, please send me an email with a one paragraph summary of what is described in this [site](https://www.quera.com/glossary/quantum-compiler) with the _hollingsQC_ in the subject line.

In general, prospective PhD and MSR Students interested in "building" things will work in the context of  systems in different verticals. I have an opening for a student to work in the area of embedded security. If you are interested in the area of securing embedded systems, please send me an email with a one paragraph summary of what is described in this [site](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10466) with the _hollingsES_ in the subject line. 

If your interest lies in the area of healthcare, please send me an email with a one paragraph summary of what is described in this [site](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9324358/pdf/diagnostics-12-01607.pdf) with the _hollingsHC_ in the subject line.
